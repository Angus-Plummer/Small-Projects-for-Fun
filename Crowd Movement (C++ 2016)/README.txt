Program to simulate the flocking behaviour of animals. 
The code shares a lot with the n-body barnes hut simulations as the barnes hut algorithm is again used for particle interactions.
Videos were produced of the resulting behaviour for a variety of parameters.
The behaviour can be influenced by the user by mouse click down creating an "attractor" at the cursor location.
